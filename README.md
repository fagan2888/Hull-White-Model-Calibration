# Hull-White-Model-Calibration
Using 228 cap prices with different expiry and maturity dates as model input. Then compiled an optimization function in MATLAB to minimize the rooted standard error between market cap prices and the cap prices derived from the model. Finally used Monte-Carlo methods to examine the model, and used 3D visualization tools to output volatility surfaces.
